1. I put all the variables in the top because it looks more organised and readable. It is also changeable, if you want change a value you have to change it only one place.

2. I used strict equal so that it can also check the type of the variable.

3. Instead of using if/else I used ternary operator because it is more concise and readable.

4. Note that, I am using ES6.
